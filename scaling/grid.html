    <p class="ingress">Here we are looking at the grid as a way to create webpages that dynamically change with screen-size.</p>
    <h2>The method: Grid columns</h2>
    <p>In the CSS, there is a simple media query with a chosen screen-width. If the screen is Maximum n, the boxes are stacked one way (underneath each other); if it is Minimum n+1, the boxes are side-by-side. (More or less.)</p>
    <p>This is a simple way to create a mobile friendly page.</p>
    <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids">Mozilla</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp">w3schools</a> have some different takes on this. Mozilla has just updated theirs, but I still suggest you look at both and decide which makes most sense for you.</p>
