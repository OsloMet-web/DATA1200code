<p>Above: Boxes with short texts. Below: Same CSS & DIV boxes, but longer texts</p>
<p>This is to illustrate how different CSS attributes can be "correct" depending on use-case.</p>

<p>UX: a primer</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sub-one">
<p><strong>U</strong>ser e<strong>X</strong>perience is more than just GUI (graphic user interface). It includes responsiveness, how simple it is to understand the tech or complete tasks, &c.</p>
<p>Some webpages have a lay-out that looks good, inviting and friendly. However, buttons, links and menus can be distributed all over the pages, making navigation surprisingly non-intuitive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.elle.com">Elle.com</a> and <a href="https://www.LinkedIn.com">LinkedIn.com</a>have attempted to solve the abundance of choice on their webpages differently. Elle has chosen to make a horisontal, very visible menu for their main sections. In addition, they have a "hamburger menu" left of the second "Elle"-logo. This menu replicates and vastly expands the number of links to sections/ sub-sections. It is not immediately obvious that these lines is a hamburger menu, though.</p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="sub-two">
<p>While Elle.com looks stylish (I assume, a designer I am not), LinkedIn looks cluttered. But the interface of Microsoft Word is cluttered as well. The UX for those who are familiar with the software is still good. And for those who needs the options &mdash; for both LinkedIn and Word &mdash; the clutter is acceptable.</p>
<p>(Notice the difference in legibility with higher line-height?)</p>
