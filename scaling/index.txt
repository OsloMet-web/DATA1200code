Fun with flex-boxes
Please scale the webpage and see what happens to the menu.
On the next pages, we shall first introduce flex-boxes, then manipulate them a bit so they "bounce" left to right based on a media-query (@media). Then I show some menus with different flex-styling. Styles 1 to 3 are relevant for boxes with text as well. The fourth example is a simple "hamburger menu" without JavaScript.
Lastly, we move on to the alternative: Grid.
