    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p class="ingress">This paragraph is styled differently by adding a class, and "styling" that class in the CSS stylesheet. The change of style will only appear if and when we connect the stylesheet to the HTML-file, inside the &lt;HEAD&gt;-element.</p>
    <h2>Heading-hierarchy should be respected!</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph. And inside this Paragraph-element, is a line-break &lt;BR /&gt;<br />before it continues with another line.
    </p>
    <p>Inside this paragraph, 
        
        there are multiple line-breaks in the code. 
        
        They do not appear in the browser.</p>
    <h2>This is the second sub-heading level 2</h2>
    <p>Every browser is set up to do basic lay-out by default. For example style the different headings, the paragraphs, and create <em>emphasis</em> to text inside &lt;em&gt;-elements, et cetera.</p>
    <p>All (or almost all) these HTML-elements can be styled in the CSS. But these are all the most basic changes! <a href="flex-box.html">Everything will become more fun when you master the more advanced code.</a></p>
