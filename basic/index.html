    <h1>Welcome to DATA1200 Inclusive web-design</h1>
    <p class="ingress">The pages you find here are coded to show specific examples. I have attempted to minimise the code and removed anything that could create clutter and make the educational content less obvious. Therefore, these pages are not pretty and they may lack some accessibility best-practice.</p>
    <h2>How to use these files</h2>
    <p>You should read both the text on the page and the <code>&lt;!--comments--&gt;</code> inside the HTML and CSS files (<code>/* comments */</code>). Sometimes, the page may look bad because I have kept the code too simplistic, but sometimes I have "commented out" code — i.e. used a comment syntax to hide code from the browser. I have attempted to add some helpful comments as well. But as this has been done in relation to specific topics I intend to cover in class, these comments are not exhaustive.</p>
    
    <h2>Sample pages</h2>
    <p>I have created a few pages. First of all, there are some super-simple HTML-pages listed below. These are used in class just like examples of how simple it can be. But I could not help it, with a nod to a much-used but now irrelevant, early repository of code, I have included a bare-minimum 'Zen garden' to be used with computers who use dark mode, or who switch modes (you should try!). Hopefully, I shall have time to show you in class.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The absolutely least code you can make a browser render: <a href="simplest.html">'simplest.html'</a></li>
        <li>Slightly more code, and enough meta-code (in the head, and with DOCTYPE) to make it "standard compliant" HTML5: <a href="simplest-legal.html">'simplest-legal.html'</a></li>
        <li><a href="simple-data1200.html">'simple-data1200.html'</a> use special characters, and therefore needs the meta-code <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code>; try to disable the code and see how <em>different browsers</em> solves this</li>
        <li>An image is added in <a href="future-cooler.html">'future-cooler.html'</a>; you should look at the links in that page for more information about including images</li>
        <li>(On the topic of images: I suggest you check out <a href="https://www.developerdrive.com/full-page-hero-image-html-css/">"Hero image"</a> as a design element)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then there is the "Flower farm".</p>

    <h3>Follo Flower Farm</h3>
    <p><a href="../flowerfarm/index.html">Link that <em>may</em> work, depending on how you attempt to access it</a>! &#128513;</p>
    <p>As a "site", a collection of interconnected pages with a uniform design, the Flower Farm leaves much to be desired! But there is a method to this madness. The first page is rather simple, but please play around with margin (or padding). The next – 'Farm' — has one static image (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) and an example of why you may use the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>-element.</p>
    <p>Then follows an example of scaleability in web pages. While the page you are reading now uses a flex-box (like the footer in the Flower farm-site), the Flowers-page uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout">grid lay-out</a>.</p>
    <p>Then there are pages concerning boxes — visible and invisible. (Will be covered in a lecture.) And lastly, "About" was intended to be about scaling. And whatever else I might need to showcase in class.</p>
