    <p><strong><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/risc-y-business-arm-wants-to-charge-dramatically-more-for-chip-licenses/">RISC-Y Business</a>:</strong> What's in store for the future of chip maker Arm? The company's owner, Softbank, has been in financial trouble lately, and that has caused Arm to bounce from one dramatic possibility to another. Initially, Arm was put up for sale, and Nvidia was the front-runner to buy the company. That plan was shut down by regulators, and now "Plan B" is an IPO, which is supposed to happen on the New York Stock Exchange sometime this year. If you want to succeed on the stock market, you've got to show revenue, and while Arm enables the sale of billions of dollars of devices around the world, the company's chip licensing scheme only brings in a comparatively small amount of moneyâ€”around $500 million a quarter.</p>
