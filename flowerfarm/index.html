<h1>Welcome to Flower Farm Follo</h1>

<p>And welcome to the page "index.html"! When a link points to a folder (also known as a directory), the browser will look for "index.html". Without an index.html, any link or web address must point to a specific file, like https://www.oslomet.no/welcome.html.</p> 
<p>This is a general paragraph. The second one, in fact. As you can see, when we define a paragraph, the browser will by default add space above or below. Now, it is not a very nicely formated paragraph, running all the way from edge to edge of the browser. Therefor, in the code, remove the comment that says "Un-comment me" in the &lt;head&gt;. (It's the "link" for "spacing.css") See more below.</p>

<p>For an example of the absolute simplest html you can expect a browser to display, go to <a href="simplest.html">simplest.html</a>.</p>
<p>
    <code>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;html&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Hello world!<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/html&gt;
    </code><br />
    ...that is all you need — but <em>correct</em> HTML needs more!
</p>

<h2>About this page</h2>
<p class="ingress">This page has a CSS-sheet that removes the default margin, so there is no space between the left-most edge of the browser and the text.</p>
<p>The <code>main.css</code> sets the 'body' to 'margin: 0'. While <code>spacing.css</code> sets the 'main' to 'margin-left: 2rem;' — that link has been commented out. Therefore, it does not apply. Doesn't look good, does it? But if you take this code and remove the commenting-out, <code>spacing.css</code> will apply and the page looks much better.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatively, simply go to "The Farm"-page.</strong> (Menu at top.) That page has both stylesheets </p>


<!-- Of the rest, only /body /html is essential for this page to resolve -->
